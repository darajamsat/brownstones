# Welcome to Brownstones!!


Brownstones is a static site generator made for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) built using 11ty. 

There are the requirements to run this system. 
1. This repository copied to your own Github repo
2. A hosting platform (I use Netlify)
3. Obsidian
4. And the Obsidian plugin "Github Publisher"

Optional:
- you may want a code editor such as Visual Studio Code if you want to edit or change themes and settings.
- or a simple text editor will do for changing the site name in the _data/settings.yaml file
